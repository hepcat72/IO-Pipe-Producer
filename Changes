Revision history for Perl extension IO::Pipe::Producer.

1.0  2003/03/07 by robleach

    Initial version.

1.1  2005/04/11 by robleach

    I added the ability to return handles on both standard output and standard
    error (when called in array context).  I also added a subroutine to do the
    same thing with a system call (as opposed to a subroutine call).

1.2  2005/04/11 by robleach

    I added the ability to return handles on both standard output and standard
    error (when called in array context).  I also added a subroutine to do the
    same thing with a system call (as opposed to a subroutine call).

1.3  2005/04/11 by robleach

    This is a modular version of producer_fork.pl.  I changed the method names,
    made a constructor, and changed the documentation.  It now ISA IO::Pipe and
    all the file handles returned are IO::Pipe::Producer instances.

1.4  2005/05/04 by robleach

    I incorporated Carp.pm, pod documentation, created $Producer::VERSION and
    $Producer::errstr variables, and edited/updated some comments.

1.5  2010/09/01 by robleach

    Updated LANL license info.

1.6  Fri Nov 16 10:51:29 2012 by robleach

    Standardized with Makemaker and updated perldoc documentation.
    Created by h2xs 1.23 with options
        -AX --skip-exporter --use-new-tests -n IO::Pipe::Producer

1.7  2014/07/11 by robleach

    Changed documentation to inform user that they must close the returned file
    handles and added a check for finished unclosed file handles.  Closes them
    if there are over 200.

1.8  2014/07/15 by robleach

    Based on test results, I reduced the maximum number of allowed unclosed
    file handles to 100, as it seemed the most any system tested could handle
    was 110.

1.9  2014/07/18 by robleach

    Added a call to tell before calling eof when checking for expired file
    handles so as to avoid blocking IO situations.

2.0  2014/07/22 by robleach

    Based on CPAN tester test results, removed file handle tracking.

2.01  2015/02/26 by robleach

    Reduced perl version requirement to 5.10.0 since testing passes.

2.02  2022/08/01 by robleach

    Added ability to retrieve exit code of the child process using $?.

2.03  2022/08/03 by robleach

    Minor documentation changes.

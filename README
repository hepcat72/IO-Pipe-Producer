=============================


                                 Producer.pm
                                 Version 2.01

  What is it?
  -----------

  Producer.pm is a module that provides methods to fork off a subroutine or
  system call and return handles on the standard output (STDOUT and STDERR).
  If you have (for example) a subroutine that processes a very large text file
  and performs a task on each line, but you need to perform further processing
  with either other subroutines or in main, normally you would have to wait
  until the subroutine returns to get its output (either by returning it or
  opening a temporary file that it produced) and continue processing.  If the
  subroutine prints its output to STDOUT (and STDERR) or you can edit it to do
  so, you can call it using a producer so that you can use the returned handle
  to continuously process each line as it's "produced".  You can chain
  subroutines together like this by having your subroutine itself create a
  Producer.  This is similar to using open() to run a system call, except that
  with this module, you can get a handle on STDERR and use it with subroutines
  as well.
